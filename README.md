### Project Explanation on Domain of Java programming dataset

## Objectives

### **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project is to develop a simple, user-friendly calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It aims to enhance understanding of fundamental programming concepts, including user input handling, control flow, and error management, using Java. The program provides an interactive interface that allows users to input numbers and select operations, ensuring accurate calculations and handling edge cases like division by zero. This project also promotes good coding practices by encouraging code modularity, clarity, and resource management through proper input stream handling.

## key Activities 
1.User Input:
The program collects two numbers and an arithmetic operation from the user.
2.Operation Selection:
It uses a switch-case block to perform the correct operation based on the userâ€™s input.
3.Calculation and Output:
The result is calculated and displayed to the user. If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program catches the issue and shows an error message.
4.Program Termination:
The scanner.close() method ensures that the program closes all input streams after completing the calculation.

## Key functions used 
Scanner Class for Input Handling:
The Scanner class is used to capture input from the user. It reads the two numbers and the desired operation.

Arithmetic Operations:
The four basic operations are implemented through separate cases (or methods):

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/) (with a check to avoid division by zero).
Control Structures (Switch-case):
Switch-case statements allow the program to select the appropriate operation based on the user's input.

Exception Handling:
Basic error handling ensures division by zero is managed gracefully, displaying an appropriate error message.

## Key insights 
Developing a simple calculator in Java offers several valuable insights into core programming concepts. First, it demonstrates the importance of user input handling through the Scanner class, teaching how to collect and process data efficiently. The use of control structures like switch-case statements highlights how decision-making logic can drive program behavior based on user input. Additionally, the project underscores the necessity of error handling, such as managing division by zero gracefully, emphasizing the role of defensive programming in creating robust applications. Furthermore, it encourages code modularity and readability, showing how organizing operations into separate logic blocks improves maintainability. Finally, this project introduces good practices for resource management, ensuring smooth execution by properly closing input streams after use.
